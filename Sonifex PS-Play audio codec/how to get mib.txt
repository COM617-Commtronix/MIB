MIB Files for SNMP Configuration
Management Information Base (MIB) files are required for SNMP applications to interact with your
Tieline codec and interpret SNMP data. The codec supports SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 MIB protocols.
The required MIB files can be downloaded from the codec using the following link in a PC web
browser connected to the same network as your codec:
Â· http://<YOUR_CODEC_ADDRESS>/mibs/tieline-mibs.zip
Save the .zip file to your PC and import the contents into the MIB browser you use to manage
SNMP-enabled network devices.
Important Note: The codec supports the attributes specified in the MIB-II standard.
Please verify that your SNMP software contains the required files as specified in RFC
